# TuneSync AI System
## A Hybrid Music Recommendation System

TuneSync AI is a sophisticated music recommendation system that blends content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to deliver highly personalized music suggestions. By analyzing audio features and user interaction data, this project creates a seamless and tailored listening experience. Data Version Control (DVC) is integrated for efficient data versioning, ensuring reproducibility and streamlined management of datasets. This project highlights my expertise in machine learning, recommendation systems, and data pipeline management.

**Features**
Hybrid Recommendation Engine: Combines content-based filtering (audio feature analysis) with collaborative filtering (user interaction data) for accurate, personalized music suggestions.
Audio Feature Analysis: Extracts and processes musical attributes like tempo, key, and energy to inform recommendations.
User Interaction Insights: Leverages user behavior data to refine and enhance suggestion quality.
Data Versioning with DVC: Ensures efficient tracking and reproducibility of datasets throughout the project lifecycle.
Scalable Pipeline: Designed with a modular architecture for easy experimentation and future enhancements.

**Tech Stack**
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (or PyTorch, depending on your implementation)
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Audio Feature Extraction: Librosa (or similar audio analysis tools)
Data Versioning: DVC
Storage: Dagshub
Other Tools: Git for version control, Jupyter Notebooks for prototyping
